Modules Utilized:

1- Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the creation and sharing of aesthetically pleasing, custom web applications for machine learning and data science.

2- Pickle
Pickle is a Python module used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures. This process involves converting a Python object into a byte stream to facilitate storage in a file or database, preserve program state across sessions, or transport data over a network.

3- String
The string module includes the utility function capwords(s, sep=None), which splits a given string into words using str.split(). It then capitalizes each word using str.capitalize().

4- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLTK is a Python library commonly used for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It helps preprocess unstructured, human-readable text data, making it analyzable programmatically.

To Execute the Program:
Run the following command in the terminal:
streamlit run app.py
